# Security Guidelines

## 🔒 Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AI Eye Analyzer app.

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

#### 1. **API Key Management**
- ✅ No sensitive API keys exposed in frontend code
- ✅ All AI API calls moved to secure Firebase Cloud Functions
- ✅ Firebase config uses environment variables with safe fallbacks
- ✅ Google Play service account keys stored securely in backend

#### 2. **Firebase Security**
- ✅ Firebase API keys are public identifiers (safe to expose)
- ✅ Authentication required for all sensitive operations
- ✅ Firestore security rules restrict access to user's own data
- ✅ Storage rules prevent unauthorized file access

#### 3. **Backend Security**
- ✅ All sensitive operations in Cloud Functions
- ✅ Proper authentication checks on all callable functions
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error handling without information leakage

#### 4. **Environment Variables**
- ✅ Sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
- ✅ Example files provided for setup
- ✅ Production vs development environment separation

### 🚫 Security Restrictions

#### What's NOT Exposed in Frontend:
- Google Play service account keys
- Firebase admin SDK credentials
- Internal API endpoints
- Database connection strings
- Encryption keys

#### What IS Safe to Expose:
- Firebase client configuration (these are public identifiers)
- Public API endpoints
- App configuration settings
- UI-related constants

### 🔧 Environment Setup

#### Frontend Environment Variables
Create `/app/.env` from `/app/.env.example`:
```bash
cp app/.env.example app/.env
```

#### Backend Environment Variables
Create `/functions/.env` from `/functions/.env.example`:
```bash
cp functions/.env.example functions/.env
```

#### Firebase Functions Config
For production, use Firebase Functions config:
```bash
# Google Play configuration
firebase functions:config:set googleplay.package_name="com.auravisionai.auravisionai"
firebase functions:config:set googleplay.service_account_key='{"type":"service_account",...}'

# Deploy configuration
firebase functions:config:get > functions/.runtimeconfig.json
```

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

#### For Developers:
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** in Cloud Functions
4. **Use proper error handling** without exposing internals
5. **Test security rules** before deployment

#### For Deployment:
1. **Set up proper environment variables**
2. **Use Firebase security rules**
3. **Enable Firebase App Check** (recommended)
4. **Monitor function logs** for security issues
5. **Regular security audits**

### 🚨 Security Checklist

- [ ] All API keys moved to environment variables
- [ ] Firebase security rules deployed
- [ ] Cloud Functions authentication enabled
- [ ] Environment files not committed to git
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Google Play service account properly configured
- [ ] App Check enabled (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Security monitoring set up

### 📞 Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:
1. Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before disclosure
